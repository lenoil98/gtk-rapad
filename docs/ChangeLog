    -   Update TGtkButton.  This object now contains some code that I will
        allow us to assign a custom property to the object pointed at by a 
        given TGTkFoo class.  This is achieved by the g_object_set() method
        and siblings.  At the moment the applicable use for a Name property so
        that we can determine which UDT/GTKObject called a given callback
        function.  At the moment the name property can be changed at will but
        if its possible it will be set during initialization of a TGtkFoo
        object and then made Read Only

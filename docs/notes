in my quest to create a vb clone i was wondering, what will need to happen
during the project managment so that i can have more than one object with the
same name globally.  i got to thinking, well VB does this by having obecjts
belong to other objects.  since Im creating the windows in the global name
space, how can i make an object 'belong' to a window, and how would i tell
the difference?

then it came to me, since the gtk library im writing is really to just
wrap gtk around a simple 'oop' style api, i could simply include the gtk
window pointer and all of the objects associated with that window as
children of a new UDT, where the UDT name is the unique name of the
'window'

type frmMain
	form as TGtkWindow
	btnOK as TGtkButton

	

	declare sub btnOK_Click()
	declare sub btnOK_MouseEnter()
	declare sub btnOK_MouseLeave()
end type

sub frmMain.btnOK_Click()

end sub

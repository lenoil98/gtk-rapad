widgets i need

    with these items I could develop a very basic concept app similar to
    the vb ide

    * list widget (list, column, tree)
    * text edit widget (possibly scintilla, GtkTextBuffer/View)
    * text display widget (rtf, html, other?)
    * resizeable container (think vb's resize reticle)

work in progress

    * TGtkWindow:

        * Set/GetX()
        * Set/GetY()
        * Set/GetHeight()
        * Set/GetWidth()

    * TGtkTextView:

        * This widget should have a set of scrollbars by default

    -   Finished the propagation of the new "Name" property throughout
        the remaining source files

    -   Started work on a new example file that will show case some of
        of the new features

2009.01.02

    -   Created svn-cleanup.sh which will automatically remove any .svn
        folders in the project tree.  Occasionally RapidSVN will lock the
        project, but will not allow me to unlock it no matter what I do.  The
        only solution I found was to delete all of the svn information,
        rename the current source, download the existing repo, merge the
        current source, and then commit the changes.  Its a pain in my ass

    -   Corrected some typing errors in the ChangeLog

    -   Updated many of the header files so that they contain some missing
        declarations.  Most of the matching source files need code to match.
        This is part of the propagation of the new "Name" property and for
        consistency

    -   Update TGtkButton.  This object now contains some code that I will
        allow us to assign a custom property to the object pointed at by a
        given TGTkFoo class.  This is achieved by the g_object_set() method
        and siblings.  At the moment the applicable use for a Name property so
        that we can determine which UDT/GTKObject called a given callback
        function.  At the moment the name property can be changed at will but
        if its possible it will be set during initialization of a TGtkFoo
        object and then made Read Only

2008.12.29

    -   New name for the project, it will now be called GtkRapad which stands
        for GTK Rapid Application Prototyping and Development.  With this
        change a new repository has been created and all of the source files
        have been updated to relect the name change

2008.12.27

    -   Created the ChangeLog
    -   Renamed TGtkMaster to TGtkApplication
    -   Merged the CommonDialog files with the TGtkApplication object
    -   Moved the CommonDialog files to their respective attic space

    -   Renamed several of the methods in CommonDialog to more accurately
        reflect their functionality

    -   Updated the widget_factory to work with the modified TGtkApplication
